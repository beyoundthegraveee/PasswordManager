# PasswordManager
This is a small student project of mine, a breed manager that encrypts a file with your passwords, and with the right program run, decrypts it.
The password to run it is: project This program adds, changes and deletes your passwords, it also records the time at which someone tried to start the program itself,
the start time is recorded in the timestamp.txt file. The file string.txt is the file where your encrypted records are stored (it can be changed).
